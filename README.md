# Project : A demo about Ceramic Network Data Model

Ceramic Network is a Peer to Peer Network for Composable Data 
Ceramic Network makes it possible for developpers to build data-rich We3 apps without the need for a traditional database(nosql, etc...) and in the process unlocks data composability and portability accross every app within the web3 ecosystem.

Apps connect to Ceramic decentralized data nertwork via an open API to: 
        -Store data
        -Retrieve data
        -Modify data
        

Web3 developers can learn more about the protocol [here](https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/welcome/)
